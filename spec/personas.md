## Persona Extensibility

### Process
- Propose a new persona only when a distinct user group has different goals, constraints, or success criteria.
- Validate with at least two example user stories that are not well served by existing personas.
- Add persona to this file and update `user_stories.md` and `acceptance_criteria.md` if it changes scope.
- Review and merge personas annually to avoid redundancy.

### Template
- Name
- Primary goal
- Constraints and needs
- Typical questions
- Pain points
- Success criteria

### Versioning Guidance
- Split a persona when behaviors diverge significantly by season or access needs.
- Merge personas when stories and acceptance criteria overlap by more than 70%.

## Open questions
- Are there specific partner or stakeholder personas (sponsors, volunteers) needed in MVP?
- Do we need an “educator” persona for school or group visits?
