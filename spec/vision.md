## Purpose
Build an OHNY conversational experience that helps people discover events, plan a weekend schedule, route between locations, and learn trivia/history, while also supporting yearlong event navigation and core site/resources info.

## North-Star Outcome
Users can ask one question and leave with a confident, conflict-free plan for their OHNY experience, including what to visit, when to go, how to get there, and a sense of place.

## Value Proposition
- Fast discovery of Open House New York events and related resources.
- Personalized scheduling guidance that fits time, location, and accessibility needs.
- Contextual trivia and history to enrich visits.
- Yearlong visibility beyond the weekend so OHNY remains relevant all year.

## Differentiation
- Event planning that blends discovery, schedule assembly, routing, and cultural context in one flow.
- Strong filtering for accessibility, virtual options, and family-friendly needs.
- Clearly communicates constraints like sold-out, lottery, or reservation status.

## Success Signals
- Users complete a weekend plan within a single session.
- Measurable conversion to event detail views.
- Low rate of “can’t find info” fallback responses.
- Positive feedback on clarity of schedule and routing guidance.

## Audience
- NYC residents and visitors during OHNY Weekend.
- Architecture enthusiasts, students, and cultural tourists year-round.
- Users with accessibility or family requirements.

## Open questions
- What “success” metric matters most in the first release: plan completion, click-through, or time-to-answer?
- Should the experience prioritize conversational warmth or rapid, utilitarian answers?
