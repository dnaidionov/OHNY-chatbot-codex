# Assumptions

## Purpose
Track assumptions that affect scope, data quality, UX, and delivery. Keep this list current so decisions remain explicit and reviewable.

## How to Use
- Add new assumptions with `Status=Active`.
- Review assumptions at each milestone (and earlier if a dependency changes).
- When confirmed, set `Status=Validated`.
- When disproven, set `Status=Invalidated` and link to the new decision.
- Append changes to the log for traceability.
