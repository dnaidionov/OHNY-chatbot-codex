## Explicit Exclusions
- Ticket sales, payment processing, or reservation management.
- Real-time transit APIs or live crowd/line data.
- User accounts, authentication, or saved itineraries.
- Full personalization beyond session-level preferences.
- Content authoring or CMS features for administrators (planned for future phase).
- Automated event data ingestion from sources beyond the provided OHNY data.

## Deferred Capabilities
- Multi-day itinerary optimization with user constraints across weeks.
- Third-party integrations like calendar sync or mapping deep links beyond basic references.
- Multilingual support beyond English.

## Open questions
- Should calendar export be considered “nice-to-have” or explicitly out of scope for MVP?
- Is volunteer or donation flow information expected in MVP or a future phase?
