# Contributing

## Purpose
Keep changes aligned with a specs-first workflow and staged approvals.

## PR Flow
## TODO
- Open a focused branch for each change.
- Reference the relevant spec files in the PR description.
- Keep scaffolding, implementation, and content updates separated when practical.

## Specs-First Rule
## TODO
- Update or add specs before implementation changes.
- Gate 1 approval is required before detailed system work.
- Gate 2 approval is required before implementation across retrieval, planning, orchestration, or API contracts.
